# Problem Background

Effective marketing strategies are essential for driving sales and revenue growth. As companies allocate resources to various marketing channels, it becomes crucial to understand the impact of each channel on the bottom line.
It is essential to identify which channels yield the most significant return on investment (ROI). This requires data-driven analysis to uncover patterns and relationships between marketing efforts and sales outcomes. In particular, understanding the influence of radio promotion budgets on sales can provide valuable insights for companies looking to optimize their marketing strategies.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of the relationship between radio promotion budgets and sales for a range of companies. By leveraging linear regression techniques, I aim to quantify the impact of radio promotion on sales and provide actionable insights for marketing decisions.
